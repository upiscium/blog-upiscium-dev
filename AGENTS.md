# Agent Operating Rules

This repository is designed for hierarchical agent-driven development.

## Durable invariants

- Before planning, editing, delegation, or project commands in a new primary-agent or Task-Orchestrator session, read `.automation/INIT.md` and complete the `initialize` skill. Initialization is read-only and failures block work.
- Depth-2 leaves inherit the parent Task Orchestrator's completed Task worktree initialization and Task Contract validation. They must not start `initialize` or the full workflow, and must not run `just agent::doctor`, `just agent::context`, or mandatory `just project::doctor` as startup prerequisites; already-allowed `project::*` commands remain usable when the bounded objective/check requires them.
- Use the repository-local Just API for Task lifecycle, publication, and integration operations.
- Main accepts exactly one startup handoff: a newly started pristine Task must use `just agent::task-start-from-issue <numeric-issue> <slug>` followed by `just agent::contract-check <task>` returning exactly `status: READY` with `mode: initial`; an existing already-launched resumable Task must use only `just agent::contract-resume-check <task>` returning exactly `status: READY` with `mode: resume`. Main launches exactly one Task Orchestrator only after the matching handoff. Placeholder Tasks and the low-level `task-start` path are not normal Main authority; `integration-pending`, `merged`, and `cancelled` are not resumable.
- Do not bypass guarded Just recipes with raw state-changing Git or GitHub commands.
- Ordinary implementation Tasks must not modify Automation Core files: `opencode.json`, `AGENTS.md`, `Justfile`, `.opencode/**`, `.automation/**`, or `.github/workflows/**`.
- `flake.nix` and `flake.lock` may be modified only when the active Task explicitly includes environment or dependency changes.
- One Task owns one branch, one worktree, one disposable Task State, and one Task Orchestrator.
- Task State is hydrated before the initial Task Orchestrator starts; resume does not rehydrate or reset it. The Task Orchestrator has no start, hydration, pre-initialization, or generic `.task-state` write authority, and must not delete or reopen Work Units during resume.
- Leaf agents execute bounded Work Units and never update `.task-state/task.md` directly.
- Leaf agents must not create subagents.
- Main Orchestrator owns Task scheduling and final integration. Task Orchestrators own implementation and publication preparation for exactly one Task.
- Task Orchestrators must not merge pull requests.
- Depth-2 leaf agents are non-interactive; they must start their final response with exactly one `status: COMPLETED`, `status: BLOCKED`, `status: NEEDS_APPROVAL`, or `status: NEEDS_DECISION` field and never perform their own permission requests.
- Task Orchestrator is the approval and decision boundary for any delegated escalation (`NEEDS_APPROVAL`/`NEEDS_DECISION`) and must re-evaluate scope, authority, least privilege, safety, alternatives, and current evidence before deciding.
- A leaf denial is not automatically promoted to Ask. After independent re-evaluation, the Task Orchestrator may originate a new Depth-1 request only when that operation is already Ask/allow under its own configured authority; the leaf profile remains unchanged.
- A user-rejected Depth-1 permission decision is final for that exact operation within the Task. It must not be retried, rephrased, re-delegated, or replaced by an equivalent operation; use recorded permission evidence and a safe alternative or BLOCKED result.
- A command or check that was not executed must never be reported as PASS.
- Unresolved leaf requests must not be inferred as approval. For `NEEDS_DECISION`, the Task Orchestrator resolves from the Task Contract/evidence when possible; if human judgment remains necessary, it asks from Depth 1 with options, tradeoffs, known facts, and a recommendation, then applies the answer.
- Each configured role model is authoritative. If it is unavailable, do not substitute another model or retry the same objective under another model; preserve relevant evidence, report the exact provider/model failure, and return `BLOCKED`.

## Initialization layers

- `AGENTS.md`: durable repository rules.
- `.automation/INIT.md`: mandatory per-session read-only initialization sequence.
- `.task-state/task.md`: active Task contract, progress, and evidence.
- bootstrap: one-time state-changing repository creation/configuration, separate from `/init`.
- `/init`: read-only validation/context resolution only; it must not rewrite `AGENTS.md` or repair Automation Core.

The call graph is intentionally non-cyclic. `task-orchestrator` may never invoke another `task-orchestrator`.

## Permission boundary

Automatically permitted operations are restricted to repository inspection, selected read-only Git/GitHub commands, safe initialization and `project::*` checks, Task-local commit, and constrained PR create/edit/ready operations through Just.

User approval is required for Task branch push, final merge, cleanup, `/tmp/opencode/**` access, and unclassified shell commands.

Raw Git/GitHub mutations, force push, amend, rebase, destructive reset/clean, direct default-branch push, admin merge, privilege escalation, and destructive store/filesystem operations are prohibited.
- Raw `rm`/`rmdir` remains denied. Bounded local deletion uses only `just agent::local-delete <relative-target> [recursive]` while the Task is explicitly `implementing`; it acquires the canonical `work-units.lock`, revalidates identity/contract/state under that lock, and holds it through mutation. Its implementation also validates the exact current Task worktree, protected paths, traversal, external paths, symlink topology, and Linux mount identity. Publication, verification, review, integration-pending, and terminal states fail closed.

## External paths

The only generally requestable external path is `/tmp/opencode/**`, and it requires approval. Other paths outside the current OpenCode workspace are denied by default.

## Worktree isolation

Agents must operate only inside the worktree assigned to their current Task. Access to sibling Task worktrees is prohibited. Static OpenCode permissions provide the default boundary; Task/worktree lifecycle guards add the dynamic sibling-worktree checks.
